			<h2>Why go whole-food, plant-based vegan?</h2>
		</div>
			<div class="box">
				<p>A vegan is someone who avoids consuming any animal and animal by-products. As Terry Mason, the former Commissioner of Health of the city of Chicago stated in Forks Over Knives documentary, "If it walked, hopped, swam, crawled, slithered, had eyes, a mama, and a dad - don't eat it!" This includes the so-called healthier meats that are just marketing gimmicks (white, lean, humane, organic, free-range, cage-free, grass-fed) and try to hide the atrocities animals have to suffer through. A whole-foods plant-based vegan also abstains or severely limits the amount of processed foods and that includes vegan and plant based alternative foods such as meat and cheese alternatives. These are usually made with high amounts of oil, salt, and preservatives. What’s left you ask? All the wonderful plant-based, flavorful, vibrant, nutrient, protein and fiber dense foods you can handle.  Here are the reasons I became a whole food plant-based vegan athlete. The top 3 were the primary reasons, the others were a very welcoming surprise.</p>

					<b>10. Herbs, spices and seeds</b><br>
					Herbs, spices and seeds have had a place in my diet but recently have been used in greater qty to replace salts, oils and more importantly some help to reduce inflammation, helps digest fats, improve digestion, antimicrobial and are antioxidants --Helloooo Turmeric--this spice deserves its own blog and video!<br><br>
					<b>9. Food more appealing</b><br>
					Eat the rainbow, for your health and for the visual appeal. Whatever season it is, you will find colorful foods to indulge in that are full of flavor. Thanksgiving should not be a table of beige foods. Carrots come in various colors, I didn’t know Japanese sweet potato came in purple, or there is a squash so easy to cut and cook called Delicata squash you can practically use a butter knife to cut and its flavor is so light and versatile.<br><br>
					<b>8. Clarity of mind, mental sharpness</b><br>
					Eliminate that mental fog that looms over by supplying you brain with vital nutrients. Moreover, when your brain is performing at its best, the rest of the body will just follow along because our state of mind is translated into our physical abilities.<br><br>
					<b>7. Longevity</b><br>
					Eat to live. In the course of making this website, I have come to learn a lot about food. The old adage, “ you are what you eat” is so true.  This is how I see it: to live longer you must consume the things that are alive, that give life.<br><br>
					<b>6. Cut grocery bill in half</b><br>
					Yes you heard that right. A whole-food plant based diet will cut your grocery bill in half. If you choose to purchase vegan alternative meat, burgers, cheese, ice cream and snacks or you prefer to purchase all organic then you won’t reap this benefit.But a whole food plant based vegan lifestyle, focused on grains, legumes, fruits and vegetables will cut your bill in half.</p>

				<div class="boxcontent">
					<p><b>5. Vanity</b><br>
					Who doesn’t like to look their best? The psychological benefits of eating well are immense.  Plant-based nutrition let’s your body reveal your best version in addition to mental health. Looking good starts in the gut; we project on the outside what we are on the inside.<br><br>
					<b>4. Fitness and Energy</b><br>
					When I eliminated dairy products from my diet completely, I noticed that the mucus build up I’d get in my throat went away. I didn’t realise how much that impacted my performance on the bike until after a couple of months. I realised I wasn’t getting winded as quickly (especially when slogging a hill). I’m in better riding form now than I ever have been. I am able to maintain a lean muscle mass and my muscles are always properly fueled.<br><br>
					<b>3. Environment</b><br>
					Now this will come as a surprise to most. Animal agri-farming is the second largest contributor to human-made greenhouse gases. The first being fossil fuels.If you want to make an impact on climate, eliminate or greatly reduce consumption of animal products. <br><br>
					<b>2. Compassion for animal</b><br>
					There is nothing humane about the conditions of factory farming and don’t kid yourself, animals are not as happy as they appear on the meat package or the milk carton. In addition, animals that are born and raised for their eggs, honey, and dairy products such as milk, butter, yogurt, cheese have an even worse fate than those raised for their flesh.<br><br>
					<b>1. Health</b><br>
					The best research on health, disease and longevity clearly shows that people who eat a diet of predominantly plant foods have a dramatically better long-term health outcome than those who eat a diet heavy in animal foods. (source: The whole foods diet by John Macky, Alona Pulde, MD and Matthew Lederman, MD).  Nicole Marquis, CEO of HipCityVeg said that within two months of adopting a plant-based diet, her father lost 25lbs, got off all his medications and put his Type 2 diabetes into remission.<p>
